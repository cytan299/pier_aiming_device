# Aiming device platform source code

![platform](https://github.com/cytan299/pier_aiming_device/blob/master/pics/IMG_0064.jpeg)

This is the source code for case that I designed for holding the
Pro-aim adjustable wedge so that it can be installed into the
Astro-Physics 119FSA adapter.  The source is written in
[Openscad](http://www.openscad.org). The _stl_ file can be found in
the _stl_ directory.
